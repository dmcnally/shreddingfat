After spending most the Christmas holidays munching on over the counter pain killers and washing them down with lashings of alcohol to numb the pain it is the first session of the year.

Fortunately for me my PT is actually a full blown physio and can take a proper look at me.  At this point I've been off the pain killers for a couple of days and I seem to be moving a lot better.

After a few basic movements and a bit of poking and prodding later the diagnosis is that it doesn't look like it is anything more serious than a bit of soft tissue damage.  It is explained to me that the injury is somewhat like when someone gets whiplash and it is usually a couple of days later when things get really sore and start to ache.

The rest of the session is really light with some rack pulls and some squats just to keep things moving and let my brain know my body can still move without issue.
