<p>This is my personal journey into staying strong as I get older.  I can't do anything about getting older but I can do something about staying strong and keeping the middle aged spread away.</p>

<p>I've had various times in my life where my back has been a real source of pain.  Through lifting and other forms of exercise I hope to keep the pain away, learn a little and hit some personal strength goals.</p>
