          <p>It’s the second session of the year and even though when I wake up in a morning my back is still a little stiff in general I’m moving a lot better.  I’m still getting the odd bit of pain here and there but it is nowhere near the level of intensity I felt over Christmas.</p>

<p>Todays session involves teaching my back and my brain that even though I’m carrying an injury it is still ok to move.  I’ve learned a lot about pain over 2022 and how with the right kind of training and stimulus you can get your brain to ignore the injury and get yourself back into a functional state faster.</p>

<p>We start off with some simple warmup exercises and progress into rack pulls building up to 90kg over a few sets.  With each set and repetition the back is starting to free up somewhat and movement is becoming even easier.  Some light squats are next, warming up with 30kg and building up to 70kg.  The back seems to have really improved now and the squats are getting deeper.  Between each set the rest times are long and discussions are had regarding how everything is feeling.</p>

<p>The session finishes with some light bench work.  The back is feeling even better now and I notice how much easier it is to get up off the bench.  Session done we’ll see how things progress over the next couple of days.</p>
